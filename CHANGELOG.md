## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed

**CRITICAL: Authentication Bug**
- Fixed token loading mismatch that caused all commands to fail after authentication
- Issue: `linear auth login` saved tokens as JSON, but all other commands tried to load them as plain strings
- Result: Every command after initial auth returned "unauthorized - token may be expired or invalid"
- Fix: Changed all commands to use `LoadTokenData()` instead of `LoadToken()`
- Affected commands: `linear init`, `linear auth status`, `linear issues`, `linear onboard`, and all others

**Duplicate Content Prevention**
- Fixed `linear init` creating duplicate Linear sections in CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md when run multiple times
- Changed from checking for "## Linear" header to checking for unique content marker
- Now properly detects if Linear section already exists before appending

### Added

**New Skill:**
- `/release` - Pre-release checklist ensuring CHANGELOG, versions, tests, and docs are updated
  - 9-step systematic validation process
  - Catches missing CHANGELOG entries before release
  - Verifies version number consistency
  - Ensures all tests pass
  - Includes rollback procedure

**Documentation:**
- Updated CHANGELOG with complete v1.2.0 release notes (was missing in v1.2.0)
- README: Moved Homebrew installation to Quickstart for better discoverability

- `--has-blockers` - Find all issues with any blockers
- `--has-dependencies` - Find issues with dependencies
- `--has-circular-deps` - Detect circular dependency chains
- `--max-depth <n>` - Filter by dependency chain depth

**New Skill:**
- `/link-deps` - Comprehensive skill for discovering and linking dependencies across backlog
  - Systematic discovery process with 4 discovery patterns
  - Example workflow for 100+ issue backlogs
  - Complete command reference for discovery and linking
  - Best practices and anti-patterns

**Enhanced Documentation:**
- README: Added search section with 8+ examples
- CLAUDE.md: Search best practices and workflow patterns
- All skills updated to reference search commands
- Enhanced `--help` output with use cases and detailed filter descriptions

### Changed

**Skills Updated:**
- `/prd` - Now searches for existing work before creating tickets
- `/triage` - Uses search to find blocked work
- `/deps` - Added discovery commands section
- All skills include cross-references to search functionality

**Search Integration:**

- Users can now run `linear issues list` without HTTP 400 errors

### Changed
- Removed "MCP server" references from all user-facing text
- Updated authentication prompts to say "automation, bots" instead of "MCP server"
- Changed onboard command title from "Light Linear MCP" to "Linear CLI"
