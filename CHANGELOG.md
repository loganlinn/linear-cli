# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

**Projects List Team Filtering:**
- Implemented team filtering for `linear projects list --team` command
- Issue: Command showed warning "Team filtering for projects is not yet implemented"
- Fix: Added `ListByTeam` method that queries projects via team relationship
- Now supports filtering projects by team using `.linear.yaml` or `--team` flag
- Example: `linear projects list --team CEN` shows only CEN team projects

## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

**Cycle Resolution Bug:**
- Fixed `linear issues update` failing when setting cycle with `--cycle` flag
- Issue: Command required explicit `--team` flag even when `.linear.yaml` config existed
- Root cause: Update command didn't read team context from config or extract from issue identifier
- Fix: Added proper team resolution hierarchy to match `create` command behavior:
  1. Explicit `--team` flag (allows moving issues to different teams)
  2. Default team from `.linear.yaml` config file
  3. Automatic extraction from issue identifier (e.g., CEN-4322 → CEN team)
- Example: `linear issues update CEN-4322 --cycle 66` now works without `--team` flag
- Added `--team` flag to update command for explicit team override

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-22

### Added

**New Skill for LLMs:**
- `/linear` - Comprehensive CLI reference optimized for LLM in-context learning
  - Token-compact format designed for frequent loading by Claude Code
  - Covers all features: semantic search, dependency tracking, cycle analytics
  - Example-driven with powerful filter combinations and real-world workflows
  - Highlights semantic search capabilities and dependency management
  - Output format guidance (minimal/compact/full) for token efficiency
  - Prominent skills installation prompt with ⚠️ warning
  - Replaces internal `/release` skill (moved to `.claude/skills/` for maintainer use)

### Changed

**Skill System:**
- Removed `/release` from user-installable skills (maintainer-only)
- Made `/linear` skill description more forceful: "MUST READ before using Linear commands"
- Added installation urgency prompt to encourage `linear skills install --all`

### Fixed

**Version Display:**
- Fixed goreleaser ldflags path: binaries now show correct version instead of "dev"
- Changed from `main.version` to `github.com/joa23/linear-cli/internal/cli.Version`

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed

**CRITICAL: Authentication Bug**
- Fixed token loading mismatch that caused all commands to fail after authentication
- Issue: `linear auth login` saved tokens as JSON, but all other commands tried to load them as plain strings
- Result: Every command after initial auth returned "unauthorized - token may be expired or invalid"
- Fix: Changed all commands to use `LoadTokenData()` instead of `LoadToken()`
- Affected commands: `linear init`, `linear auth status`, `linear issues`, `linear onboard`, and all others

**Duplicate Content Prevention**
- Fixed `linear init` creating duplicate Linear sections in CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md when run multiple times
- Changed from checking for "## Linear" header to checking for unique content marker
- Now properly detects if Linear section already exists before appending

### Added

**New Skill:**
- `/release` - Pre-release checklist ensuring CHANGELOG, versions, tests, and docs are updated
  - 9-step systematic validation process
  - Catches missing CHANGELOG entries before release
  - Verifies version number consistency
  - Ensures all tests pass
  - Includes rollback procedure

**Documentation:**
- Updated CHANGELOG with complete v1.2.0 release notes (was missing in v1.2.0)
- README: Moved Homebrew installation to Quickstart for better discoverability

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added

**Unified Search Command:**
- `linear search` - Powerful search across all Linear entities (issues, cycles, projects, users)
- Text search: `linear search "authentication"`
- Entity type filtering: `--type issues|cycles|projects|users|all`
- Cross-entity search: `linear search "oauth" --type all`

**Dependency Filtering:**
- `--blocked-by <ID>` - Find issues blocked by a specific issue
- `--blocks <ID>` - Find issues that block a specific issue
- `--has-blockers` - Find all issues with any blockers
- `--has-dependencies` - Find issues with dependencies
- `--has-circular-deps` - Detect circular dependency chains
- `--max-depth <n>` - Filter by dependency chain depth

**New Skill:**
- `/link-deps` - Comprehensive skill for discovering and linking dependencies across backlog
  - Systematic discovery process with 4 discovery patterns
  - Example workflow for 100+ issue backlogs
  - Complete command reference for discovery and linking
  - Best practices and anti-patterns

**Enhanced Documentation:**
- README: Added search section with 8+ examples
- CLAUDE.md: Search best practices and workflow patterns
- All skills updated to reference search commands
- Enhanced `--help` output with use cases and detailed filter descriptions

### Changed

**Skills Updated:**
- `/prd` - Now searches for existing work before creating tickets
- `/triage` - Uses search to find blocked work
- `/deps` - Added discovery commands section
- All skills include cross-references to search functionality

**Search Integration:**
- Comprehensive help text with 4 use cases
- Discovery patterns documented across all skills
- Weekly unblocking routine recommended

### Fixed
- Token sanitization for OAuth tokens (added Bearer prefix validation)
- Invalid Authorization header issues
- Missing flags on various commands

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- `--version` flag to display version information
- Version is auto-generated from git tags during build
- Comprehensive OAuth setup documentation for agent mode
- Specific callback URL guidance (`http://localhost:3000/oauth-callback` for agents)

### Fixed
- **Critical**: GraphQL pagination query error (removed invalid `totalCount` field from IssueConnection)
- Users can now run `linear issues list` without HTTP 400 errors

### Changed
- Removed "MCP server" references from all user-facing text
- Updated authentication prompts to say "automation, bots" instead of "MCP server"
- Changed onboard command title from "Light Linear MCP" to "Linear CLI"
- Updated README with correct Homebrew installation instructions
- Updated manual download URLs to use tar.gz archives
